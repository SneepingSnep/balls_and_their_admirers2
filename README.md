Hello. This weeks assignment was used for getting to know structs and unions and their collaboration.
In the main assignment. I made a struct and filled an array with the struct, so that i could manipulate their position and keep it.
In the second part (optional) i used a Union in my struct as to first be able to identify the type of data that would be in the object in memory.
To run the main code you use "make mainw" to compile the code, and then "make gow" to run the code.
To run the optional code you use "make mainwalt" to compile the code, and the "make gowalt" to run the code.

The hard thing about this assignment was to make the struct with the union in it.
